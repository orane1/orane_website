 </center>


<p> My name is Orane Sostaric, iâ€™m 18 years old . I come from Dreux a town in the departement of Eure-Et-Loire . I studied at Edward Branly high school where I followed a general baccalaureate with the specialities of mathematics, NSI and economics and social science (SES), which I stopped in the 12th grade. I succesfully obtained my baccalaureate with honors.</p>

<p>Throughout my three years in high school, I was part of an "association". Where we created several projects . Like this project where we collected several donations of clothing to be able to create a solidarity thrift store within the high school to allow high school students to have clothes for free. We also created boxes with hygiene products and winter clothes to be distriuted to people in need. I also participated in tutoring which had to project to assist students with difficulties. Being involved in these projects taught me a lot about becoming more mature gaining responsability and to meet several people who taught me a lot.This allowed me to be less shy and reserved and more open to others
