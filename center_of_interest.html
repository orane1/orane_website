<h3> Movies and documentary  <img src="pop_corn.jpg" alt="logo" width="70px"></h3>

<p> In my free time I really like watching films and documentaries on several subjects. But I prefer those about true stories, paranormal stories, serial killer, kidnapping. But also about people who have succeeded in their lives when they started from nothing, I find it interesting to see how people  succeed in their lives</p>

<h3> Art and books </h3>
<p>  I also like visiting museums, it allows me to learn about the history, culture, art and way of life of other countries or France. I most often do these visits alone because I find that it makes all these outings more interesting; it allows you to be alone with yourself, which is very important.
I also read a lot of books on subjects that are interesting  or related to my values. It allows me to learn a lot, and disconnect from my phone</p>
